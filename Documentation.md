# Documentation

If you launch the original MOBIB extractor code, you will find that it is no longer selecting and reading at the right locations except for the holder data. To observe the new commands, I launched a Windows VM, setup a proxy and went to [https://www.stib-mivb.be/mystib/Home/Index] . There you can download a browser plugin that allows you to connect to their website and do online top-ups.

The software is installed in `C:\Users\pentest\AppData\Local\Programs\MOBIB_Reader`. The interesting part is that the software was built with .Net: `MOBIB_Reader.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows`. If you open it with a .Net disassembler like Telerik's JustDecompile, you'll see that the software is logging everything it does at `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%mobib_reader.log`.

Small excerpt of that log file:

The plugin receives base64 encoded raw APDUs from the server, send them to the card, then sends the results back to the server as base64 encoded raw response APDUs.

## APDUs

Here is the list of hex encoded APDUs. They need to be sent in that order (at least for the select-then-read order). I figured out most of them but some (marked "unknown") still needs to be analyzed.

## Event logs

The card contains 3 or 4 "event logs" from checking in with the card (see above).

In 2025, the station number for bus journeys can now be found (tentatively) between bits 67:83 of this log. 
Tram journeys have the same scheme.
