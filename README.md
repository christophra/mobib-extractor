# MOBIB Card Reader - 2017 Edition

Read data stored on your MOBIB card (STIB/MIVB, SNCB/NMBS, TEC).

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

My objective with this project is to:

- get rid of this bloated Tk GUI and have a simple CLI tool
- use valid APDUs for recent smartcards and adapt parsing code
- rewrite parsing code in a Pythonic way
- clean install & packaging

Supports both contacted and contactless smart card readers.

# Background Information

If you want to know about new APDUs and format, check the [documentation](Documentation.md)

Two scripts are available at the moment:

- extract.py that reads owner details and last three known locations
- test.py that emulates commands sent by the STIB plugin

# Credits

Initial research project was performed by Tania Marting <tania.martin@uclouvain.be> and Jean-Pierre Szikora <jean-pierre.Szikora@uclouvain.be> from UCL GIS. All credits goes to them for their amazing work with this :) 

This repo is a fork of [qkaiser/mobib-extractor](https://github.com/qkaiser/mobib-extractor), hoping to continue keeping this usable in 2025.
